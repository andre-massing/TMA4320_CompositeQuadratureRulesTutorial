# TMA4320 Composite Quadrature Rules Tutorial

This repository is dedicated to implementing composite quadrature rules, writing tests for them, and working with Git and GitHub. The main purposes of this repository are:

1. **Implement Composite Quadrature Rules**: Develop functions to approximate integrals using composite quadrature methods such as the composite trapezoidal rule, composite Simpson's rule, and composite midpoint rule. 
2. **Write Tests**: Create and run tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented quadrature rules.
3. **Debug Code**: Practice debugging code using the built-in Python debugger.
4. **Work with Git and GitHub**: Practice version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.
